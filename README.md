# Patchwork

**Patchwork** is a **PHP 5.4+ full-stack web framework**, which main purpose is to gather the best tools available together in order to provide a minimalist yet complete start point for building small to medium **web applications**.

## Round table

### Package management

- [Composer]() : the now standard package manager for PHP.

- [NPM]() : node.js's package manager, which is used to install front-end dependencies along with Napa.

### Back-end

- [Silex]() : a micro-framework built around Symfony components, which provides a dependency injection container and a basic web application structure. It comes in Patchwork along with multiple service providers.

- [Twig]() : Symfony's *de facto* templating engine, used by default in Silex. It comes in Patchwork along with multiple extensions.

- [Swift Mailer]() : Symfony's *de facto* mail sender, used by default in Silex.

- [RedBean]() : an ORM which particularity is that it creates your database schema itself as you write code. Its integration with Silex is handled by a dedicated service provider, in order to make it available as an instance rather than a static facade.

- [Monolog]() : the standard logger for PHP.

- [Environ]() : an environment manager which allows defining environments triggered by a boolean callback (typically based on hostname detection) and executing environment-specific code.

- [Image Workshop]() : an image library used for resizing and cropping images.

- [PHPUnit]() : one of the major unit tests tools for PHP.

### Front-end

- [gulp]() : a task runner for asset processing and optimization, which allows for live compilation and reloading during development. Along with the libraries listed below, it makes use of [JSHint]() and image minification and font conversion utilities.

- [LESS]() : a CSS preprocessor.

- [Browserify]() : a front-end JavaScript dependency manager, which allows using CommonJS's `require` method to help keep a good code structure.

- [Behat]() and [Mink]() : functional tests tools, that can pilot a browser to use your app. Running JavaScript-capable tests will require the use of [Selenium]().

## Structure and installation

All code that could possibly handle inheritance/dispatching in one way or another (which includes PHP classes, basic LESS stylesheets and [NicEdit](), a JavaScript WYSIWYG editor) is contained into the framework's **core**, available as a separate package. The framework's repository itself is mainly a sample app - about pizzas - designed to help you getting started quickly.

The best way to start is to use Composer, which will clone that repository and install all required dependencies :

```
composer create-project neemzy/patchwork pizza
```
